                    <p> One visit to Nepal inspired one of our developers to want to aid
the relief efforts in this country after the desastruous earthquake of
April 2015.  A look at the colorful and handmade pashminas being sold 
on the streets, sparked the idea for The Pashmina Project.  This is where
the combined experiences of our diverse team came to play.  We each had
knowledge of locally handcrafted products from our different countries, and
decided that we wanted to support the craft of these people.</p>
