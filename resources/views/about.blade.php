                <h2>The Pashmina Project</h2>
                <h3>This is how it all started. One country, one product.</h3>
                <p> One visit to Nepal inspired one of our developers to want to aid the relief efforts in this country after the disastruous earthquake of April 2015.  A look at the colorful and handmade pashminas being sold on the streets, sparked the idea for The Pashmina Project.  This is where the combined experiences of our diverse team came to play.  We each had knowledge of locally handcrafted products from our different countries, and decided that we wanted to support the craft of these people.</p>
